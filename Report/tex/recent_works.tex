\subsection{KCMBT}

KCMBT is a tool for k-mer counting which implemented tree based algorithm. It speeds up based on multiple burst trees\cite{KMCBT}. It claimed that it has outperformed KMC 2 and presented the graph showed in Figure \ref{fig:KCMBT}. But the tools is not publicly accessible till now. As it is a conference paper, it seems to have some issues with reliability.

\subsection{Benchmarking Paper}
A very recent assessment paper was published on April 4 of this year. Here, they experimented with almost all existing tools. As Jellyfish 1 could perform well till k = 31, they took this value of k. As a large value of k, they have taken k = 55. They have shown the comparison based on three important factors.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Memory Usage (RAM)\ref{fig:Assess2}
	\item Run-time\ref{fig:Assess1}
	\item Disk I/O\ref{fig:Assess3}
\end{enumerate}

	\caption{Comparison among existing K-mer counting tools with respect to Run-time.\cite{reviewAllInOne}}

There experimented result almost agrees with our analysis.
